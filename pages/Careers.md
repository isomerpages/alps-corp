Since our inauguration on 01 July 2018, ALPS has made great strides in our efforts to transform Singapore’s healthcare landscape. We are only just getting started, and we are looking for committed, dedicated individuals like yourself to help usher in a new age of public healthcare for Singapore.

As Singapore transitions to become a 'super-aged' society - with nearly one in four citizens seen at 65 years old and above by the year 2030 - demand for medical procedures and follow-up services, as well as drugs and medications will also rise.
 
As such, piecemeal solutions aren’t enough. 

Our approach must be bold and transformative – to design and execute a national-level, end-to-end supply chain blueprint, in partnership with all Public Healthcare Institutions, to ensure everyone, regardless of age, can access appropriate and necessary treatments and medications in the years ahead.
