As part of the National Pharmacy Strategy of re-designing the pharmacy supply chain, the **National Central Fill Pharmacy (NCFP)** model was established to transform medicine delivery service to one that is integrated with pharmaceutical care services to meet patients’ needs. It aims to provide timely, convenient access to medications supported by expertise and advice from pharmacy services.

**NCFP** will fulfill medication delivery orders received from healthcare institutions in a central location. This model will boost efficiency by consolidating the picking and packing of pharmaceutical drugs and delivering them direct to patients’ homes or their preferred collection points island-wide. The co-location with Central Warehouse coupled with the centralization of logistic processes also allows better synergies in supply chain, and healthcare institutions to focus more on direct patient care delivery.

NCFP One, located at at 4 Pandan Avenue will commence operations with the inclusion of primary care under public healthcare. From thereon, it will expand its services to other public healthcare institutions in subsequent phases. In addition, NCFP One will support medication delivery services for Healthier SG enrolled GP clinics.
