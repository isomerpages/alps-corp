<p>ALPS is pleased to be invited to present at the ERM &amp; Data Protection
Webinar organised by NHG on 17 October 2024.</p>
<p>The presenters - made up of Ms Agnes Tiong, Ms Chong Pei Li, Mr Keith
Lim, and Mr Andy Gan - outlined several strategies undertaken by ALPS to
enhance public healthcare supply chain resiliency.</p>
<p>Special thanks also to Mr William Ong, Director, Strategic Procurement,
who assisted in the preparation of the presentation but was unable to attend
the Webinar.</p>
<p>On the national front, ALPS enlarged and diversified its pool of vendors
and built up buffer stocks of medical supplies and drugs at our Central
Warehouse. At the institutional level, we centralised oversight of inventory
and consumption data to determine how best to deploy stocks to Public Healthcare
Institutions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ALPS' Enterprise Risk Office took a holistic approach to identifying,
evaluating and mitigating potential risks across healthcare supply chain.</p>
<p>As the national healthcare supply chain manager, ALPS adopts the best
practices in procurement, safe handling and storage, and timely deliveries
of essential medical supplies to all PHIs in pursuance of quality, un-interrupted
patient care services.</p>
