Today as we celebrate our 3rd Anniversary, we would also like to take time to thank our ALPS colleagues during this COVID period. Through their commitment, hard work, and unity, medical supplies were able to reach patients in time and ensure continuity of healthcare operations.

Healthcare has displayed its resiliency through supply chain power because of these unsung heroes.

Their hard work has shown us that we shall not be deterred from any crisis, and we will continue to forge ahead as one ALPS and one healthcare!

Thank you [Artist Lawrence Koh](https://www.facebook.com/SingaporeSandArt) for the wonderful sand art video!
