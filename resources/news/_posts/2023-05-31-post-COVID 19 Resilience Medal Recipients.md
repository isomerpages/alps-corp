The COVID-19 Resilience Medal features new ribbon colours, to indicate that they have been specially presented for the awardees’ service in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. The colours and design of the medal ribbon are inspired by two recognisable symbols of the pandemic – a negative Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result (a single red stripe on a white base), and the familiar green of the TraceTogether application.

The COVID-19 Resilience Medal and COVID-19 Resilience Certificate are new national awards to recognise the substantive contributions of those who participated directly in Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. About 99,000 individuals and 800 teams will receive the medal and certificate.

The front of the silver medal is encircled with its name, ‘COVID-19 Resilience Medal’. A shield with five stars and a crescent moon forms the centrepiece of the medal, representing Singapore as a young nation and our ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality.

Similar to most Singapore state medals, the CRM carries the State Crest on its reverse side. It is engraved with the phrase, ‘SG United • Stronger Together’ – the familiar rallying call for unity and a reminder of our resilience throughout the pandemic.
 
<span style="font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: bold;">Design elements on medal face</span>

Woven into the design are several symbols that represent the key qualities that Singapore has displayed as a nation in our fight against COVID-19. The eight arrow-like elements embellishing the medal’s rim represent our adaptability and swift responses in tackling the pandemic, while the intertwining lines represent how Singaporeans stood united against an invisible foe.

The bar of the medal features the Vanda Miss Joaquim, Singapore’s national flower. It blooms all-year round, representing our resilience. The laurels on either side of the Vanda Miss Joaquim pay tribute to and recognise the awardee’s efforts in the battle against COVID-19.
