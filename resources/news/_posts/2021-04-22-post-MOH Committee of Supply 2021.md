In the recent Committee of Supply on 5 March 2021, the Health Minister, Mr Gan Kim Yong, shared the various initiatives that MOH will be embarking on, aiming to improve the health of Singaporeans and the healthcare system for cost-effectiveness and efficiencies.

ALPS was mentioned by Mr Gan in achieving cost efficiencies through driving economies of scale through consolidated procurement.

ALPS will continue to achieve such economies of scale through partnerships with our stakeholders and value partners!
