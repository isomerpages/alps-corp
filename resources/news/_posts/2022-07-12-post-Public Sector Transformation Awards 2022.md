As ALPS celebrates its [4th Anniversary](/resources/news/20220701-alps-anniversary/), we are humbled to receive the **One Public Service Award** for **Exemplary Inter-agency Collaboration, COVID-19 PCR Testing Capacity Expansion**!

ALPS was commended for its efforts to centrally procure and manage supplies, and ensuring a resilient supply chain of critical testing supplies (such as reagents, swabs, universal transport mediums, PPE, and more) despite global supply chain challenges.

Special mention to **ALPS' Strategic Procurement (Medical Supplies) Team** for their efforts and hard work in this collaboration!

ALPS is a member of the multi-agency collaboration to control the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Fellow award recipients include **A\*STAR, DSO, DSTA, EDBB, HPB, HSA, HTX, IHiS, JTC, MINDEF, MND, MOH, SLA, and URA**.

Under the MOH's stewardship, we aggressively raised the national PCR resting capacity to beyond 60,000 tests per day. This by training and deploying 3,500 swabbers to 750 swabbing sites island-wide with nearly 30 laboratories testing the PCR swab samples and certifying the results.

The **One Public Service Award is part of the Public Sector Transformation (PST) Awards**, a Whole-of-Government pinnacle platform to recognise and reward public officers and public agencies for excellence in their work and organisational practices.

This year, the **COVID PST Awards** recognises 97 recipients across 9 award categories who have made sacrifices and worked hard to help citizens and businesses during the pandemic while displaying PST traits such as agility, service excellence and innovation.
