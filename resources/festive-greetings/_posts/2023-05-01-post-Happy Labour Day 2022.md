Today is Labour Day where we pay tribute to all workers for their contributions toward nation building!

ALPS would like to extend our appreciation for the tireless and selfless work done by all #healthcareworkers, including the supply chain colleagues at the public healthcare institutions, throughout the pandemic.

Thank you for pushing on and weathering through pandemic! 

All of you are our heroes!
