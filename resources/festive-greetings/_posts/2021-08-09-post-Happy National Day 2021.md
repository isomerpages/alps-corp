Thanks to years of nation-building, Singapore has weathered many crises through sheer tenacity and unity shown by its people.

No matter what the future holds, we will continue to face any situation head on, with courage and strength.

Just like this year’s NDP theme song has “We did it before, and we’ll do it again.”, we will emerge stronger from any crisis, together.

Happy 56th National Day, Singapore!
