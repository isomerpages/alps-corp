Deepavali is marked by the lighting of oil lamps called diyas, hence its other common name -&nbsp;Festival of Lights. The festival is a joyous one, representing the triumph of light over darkness.

Please join us in wishing our Hindu friends and their families a very Happy Deepavali - Festival of Lights.

May the glowing diyas fill their homes with warmth, love and happiness.
