In many households, celebrations start tonight with the all-important 团圆饭 or Reunion Dinner. Family members of several generations gather to feast on an array of festive dishes as well as enjoy each other's company. 

Symbolically, the Reunion Dinner paves the way to a year of 'abundance', one filled with love, joy, luck and opportunities.

ALPS wishes you and your loved ones an 'abundance' of health, happiness and good fortune this year.

But first, enjoy the long weekend!
