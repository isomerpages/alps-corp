<p>Dear valued partner,</p>
<p>The evolving global macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape has affected
many of us, in our personal and family lives, as well as our industry.
These events have highlighted the importance of embracing supply chain
resilience and change. However, it has also emphasised the need for partnerships
in the healthcare industry so that we can stand together in unity to weather
these challenges.</p>
<p>Being the agency and manager of public healthcare supply chain, ALPS has
engaged many suppliers to ensure the continuous provision of medical supplies
and drugs for the much-needed care for our patients. I am heartened to
know that many of you have stood forward to render assistance so that our
patients receive the appropriate care needed while ensuring the whole healthcare
system is sustained. On behalf of public healthcare, thank you for standing
alongside us and for the support given despite the difficulties.</p>
<p>As ALPS moves alongside the whole public healthcare in transforming Singapore's
healthcare, ALPS will continue to leverage on the value partnership established
with you in bringing quality products and services for the benefit of all
patients. ALPS will consolidate more categories and establish more national
contracts to achieve an all-winning situation for both the public healthcare
and our valued partners.</p>
<p>To ensure our outreach to all existing valued partners as well as potential
partners, ALPS will publish a quarterly <strong><a href="/sourcing-events/national-level/overview/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Sourcing Calendar</a></strong> on
our website where you will be able to see the upcoming sourcing events.
This will allow vendors and suppliers to make the necessary preparation
for the sourcing event that you may wish to participate in.</p>
<p>ALPS will also be informing all vendors and supplies through <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/alpshealthcaresupplychain" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ALPS Facebook</a></strong> to
prompt the upcoming sourcing events. As the calendar acts as a source of
reference, vendors and supplies are also encouraged to register and log
into <strong><a href="https://supplier.ariba.com/https://supplier.ariba.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SAP Business Network</a></strong> for
the updated sourcing details. Please note that all national sourcing events
shall be conducted via <strong><a href="https://supplier.ariba.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SAP Business Network</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for the continued support to Singapore's healthcare
and we look forward to a long-lasting relationship.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Peter Tay</strong>
<br>Chief Executive Officer, ALPS</p>
