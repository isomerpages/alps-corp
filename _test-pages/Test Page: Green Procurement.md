The ALPS Green Procurement Guidelines align with SG2030 Green Procurement Requirements under the GreenGovSG framework, which includes, but is not limited to, Air-Conditioners, Refrigerators, Televisions, Lamps, Water Fitting and Equipment, Building Products, Printing Paper, ICT Equipment and Vehicles.

ALPS is committed to protecting the environment through its Procurement and Supply Chain Practices. Since 2022, ALPS has gradually rolled out Green Procurement across Public Healthcare Institutions to improve energy and water efficiency, and to reduce and recycle waste.


**What's new:**

As a next step to support national sustainability goals and decarbonise the healthcare supply chain, ALPS has launched a Sustainability Questionnaire that will be used in our sourcing events.

Help us understand your current environmental practices, identify opportunities, and make more sustainable procurement decisions.
