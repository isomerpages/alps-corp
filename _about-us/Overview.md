ALPS' Vision, Mission, and Value statements challenge us to put the needs and well-being of all customers (direct or indirect) and stakeholders, who engage our services, during our daily work activities. The statements also propel us to constantly examine our supply chain strategies, approaches, and processes in delivering value-based supply chain solutions to public healthcare, as part of MOH's strategic thrust.

As a public healthcare supply chain agency, we shall extend our reach, progress with agility, and invest for resiliency. To achieve so, we shall leverage on building good relationships with our stakeholders and suppliers, re-engineer our processes for synergies and foster the development of our people and organisation's values.

Our growth drivers are specific focus areas for future growth, thereby creating innovation, delivering execution excellence, leveraging technology for business transformation, generating partnerships, and inspiring our employees through empowerment.
