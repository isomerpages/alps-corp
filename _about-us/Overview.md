The Vision, Mission, and Value statements of ALPS (Agency of Logistics and Procurement Services) serve as a compass that guides us towards supply chain excellence to give support to the stakeholders in the public healthcare sector, contributing to the overall health and well-being of the community.

In order to meet the objectives set forth by our statements, we are committed to constantly evaluating and improving our supply chain strategies and processes. This includes working closely with the Ministry of Health to align with their strategic goals and deliver value-based solutions.

As we move forward, we are dedicated to expanding our reach and capabilities, adapting with speed and flexibility, and investing in building resilience.

Our growth drivers - innovation, execution excellence, technology transformation, partnerships, and empowerment - are crucial focus areas that will propel us towards our goal of becoming a leader in healthcare supply chain. By embracing these drivers, we are confident in our ability to drive positive change and deliver exceptional outcomes for our customers and stakeholders.
