ALPS is transforming Singapore's healthcare supply chain with the launch and operations of **Central Warehouse One** (CWH1)- a purpose-built, system integrated, end-to-end logistics facility.

ALPS **CWH1** was developed to support the stringent and exacting needs of the public healthcare institutions (PHIs). Where previously each PHI managed its own inventory, today they can focus on delivering healthcare services to patients, with ALPS **CWH1** and centralised IT systems working behind the scenes to take care of the PHIs' needs and inventory control.

ALPS **CWH1** maintains product integrity and ensures they are received, stored, and delivered in the right conditions thanks to state-of-the-art environment control systems and flexible storage configurations, allowing ALPS to handle a wide array of inventory - from cold chain products to ambient medical supplies. These technologies are extended to the operations of **[National Central Fill Pharmacy One](/national-logistics/national-central-fill-pharmacy-one/)**, co-located within ALPS **CWH1**, further boosting both facilities' operational efficiencies and synergies.

ALPS has also developed its own inventory control IT systems to provide real-time tracking of supply chain activities. Combined with our advanced workflow engines, ALPS **CWH1** can centralise inventory planning and demand-forecasting, and effectively manage any supply chain adverse events. Deliveries to the PHIs are prioritised for timeliness and safe, secure handling of medical supplies.  

ALPS is committed to advancing Singapore's healthcare supply chain for the betterment of allÂ Singaporeans!
