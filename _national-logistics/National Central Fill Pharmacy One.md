Ever wonder what goes on behind the scenes at our **National Central Fill Pharmacy One** (NCFP One)? 

It all starts with the transmission of valid prescription orders into ALPS **NCFP One** for centralised picking, packing and checking of medicines. The workflow engine used by **NCFP One** helps to reduce the chances of errors and improve accuracy in the fulfilment of prescription orders.

ALPS was recently lauded by the Centre of Regulatory Excellence Standards Development Organisation  (CoRE-SDO) for the company's implementation of Singapore Standards 644 to its medication delivery services to consumers.

The revised SS 644 standard is a risk-based approach that allows 3rd party delivery vendors to optimise their operational efficiencies and reduce unnecessary expenses, without sacrificing public healthcare's stringent medication controls, and in keeping with patient safety requirements.

The end result is a medications handling and delivery model built on trust and efficiency in which cost savings are ultimately channeled back to public healthcare and to patients.
