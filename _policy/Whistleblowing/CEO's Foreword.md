  <p>Dear colleagues,</p>

	<p>As members of the public healthcare, ALPS will continuously strive to bring value-based supply chain solutions through partnering with stakeholders, customers, and suppliers. To do so, we are committed to conducting business with the highest standards of governance, ethics, and accountability to all individuals that we will encounter during our daily work.</p>

  <p>Underpinning such standards would be our core values, I2SET where the first value. "Integrity", sets the expectation for all of us in doing the right thing even when no one is watching, being honest and truthful in our actions, and being fair, open, and transparent in our business dealings at all times.</p>

  <p>Together with MOHH Group, I am pleased to announce the launch of our whistleblowing channel that will take effect as of today.</p>

  <p>MOHH Group Whistleblowing is an independent whistleblowing service managed by an independent and neutral third party, Deloitte, which provides a formalise
platform to report any fraud or wrongdoings anonymously. This whistleblowing channel is in addition to the ALPS senior management's open-door policy for staff to report any violations or concerns.</p>

  <p>I trust that with this additional channel, we would have greater confidence in reporting any breaches, irregularities, conflict of interest, misuse or misappropriation of assets, information &amp; funds, corruption &amp; bribery, and safety &amp; HR related matters found within ALPS. All reporting shall undergo an investigation to ascertain the facts. On this note, I would also like to use this opportunity to share that ALPS strictly prohibits any individuals from discharging, disciplining, or retaliating against any staff who make the responsible choice in reporting such breaches and irregularities.</p>

  <p>If you know such wrongdoings happening within ALPS, do not turn a blind eye, do not keep silent. I encourage you to report it via MOHH Group Whistleblowing or you could email to any of the senior management to help make ALPS a fair,
safe, and honest place to work in and work with.</p>

  <p>Thank you.</p>

  <br>

  <p><b>Yong Hwee Yee</b><br>Chief Executive Officer, ALPS</p>
