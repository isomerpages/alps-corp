#### Blow the Whistle on Misconduct

Workplace misconduct have negative effects on our work environment.

Help us fight against workplace misconduct by reporting it on ALPS Whistleblowing, an anonymous and independent whistleblowing service managed by Deloitte.

  

If you see or suspect something wrong, such as:

* Asset Misappropriation (e.g. Theft, Fraudulent Disbursement)

* Breach of Confidentiality (e.g. Data, Information and etc.)

* Conflict of Interest

* Corruption & Bribery

* HR Matters (e.g. General Misconduct)

* Safety Issues (e.g. Patient Safety, Workplace Safety)
* Others

  

All reports made are kept completely confidential and you are not required to reveal your identity unless you choose to do so.
