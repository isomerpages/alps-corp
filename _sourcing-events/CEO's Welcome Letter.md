	<p>Dear valued partner,</p>
	<p>2020 has been a testing year – not only it tested the resiliency of the nation but also tested the supply chain capabilities within Singapore. Fortunately, with the support from your company, Singapore’s healthcare system has withstood the test and emerged stronger.</p>
	<p>While the situation is still not out of the woods, ALPS will propel forward in transforming the supply chain for public healthcare. We will continue to leverage on the valuable partnership established with you in bringing quality products and services for the benefit of all patients. To this end, ALPS will consolidate more categories and establishing more national contracts to achieve an all-winning situation for public healthcare and our valued partners.</p>
